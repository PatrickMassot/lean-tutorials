Tactics
=======

exact
-----

`exact H` : This tactic will close a goal equal to the type of `H`.

Example 1:

```
H : x = y + 1
⊢ x = y + 1
```
The `exact H` tactic will close that goal.

Example 2:
```
H : a + r = b + r → a = b
⊢ a + r = b + r → a = b
```

The tactic `exact H` will close that goal.

Example 3:

```
⊢ succ a ≠ 0
```

The tactic `exact zero_ne_succ a` will close that goal, because `zero_ne_succ a` is a proof that `succ a ≠ 0`.

assumption
----------

This tactic is a variant of `exact`, which closes any goal for which there is already a proof in our assumptions. For example if the assumptions and goal look like this:

```
H : x = y + 1
⊢ x = y + 1
```

then the `assumption` tactic will close this goal.

refl
----

The `refl` tactic will close any goal of the form `a = a`, and more generally any goal of the form `x R x` if `R` is a binary relation which is reflexive.

induction
----------

`induction n with d hd`

Does induction on `n`. Assumes that `n` is the kind of thing you can do induction on (for example `n : mynat` would be a great example).

Running the tactic `induction a with d hd` changes the goal from
```
1 goal
P : mynat → Prop,
n : mynat
⊢ P n
```

to

```
2 goals
case mynat.zero
P : mynat → Prop
⊢ P 0
case mynat.succ
P : mynat → Prop,
d : mynat,
hd : P d
⊢ P (succ d)
```

Example:

`induction n with d Hd,`

takes

```
1 goal
n : mynat
⊢ 0 + n = n
```

to

```
2 goals
case mynat.zero
⊢ 0 + 0 = 0
case mynat.succ
d : mynat,
Hd : 0 + d = d
⊢ 0 + succ d = succ d
```

cases
-----

A "weaker" variant of induction, where we do not get an inductive hypothesis; the `cases a with b` tactic simply changes a general `a : mynat` into the two cases `a = 0` and `a = succ b`.

rw
---

Does a "rewrite". If `H : a = b` then `rw H` changes all `a`'s in the goal to `b`'s. Note that in contrast to core Lean, 
the natural number game's `rw` does not try to close the goal with `refl`.
If you want Lean 3.4.2's `rw`, use `rewrite`.

Variant: if you want to change all `b`'s to `a`'s then `rw ←H` works (use `\l` to get the left arrow)

Variant: if you want to change all `a`'s to `b`'s in hypothesis `H2` then `rw H at H2` works.

The tactic also works with true/false statements; it will rewrite "iff"s. For example `le_def a b : a ≤ b ↔ ∃ (c : mynat), b = a + c`, so `rw le_def` will change `a ≤ b` to `∃ (c : mynat), b = a + c`.



Example:
```
H : a = b + 3
⊢ 0 + a = a + b
```

Then `rw H` changes the goal to

```
⊢ 0 + (b + 3) = b + 3 + b
```

Example:

If the hypotheses are
```
h1 : a = b + 1
h2 : 1 + a = 7
```

then `rw h1 at h2` changes `h2` to

```
h2 : 1 + (b + 1) = 7
```

Example: if the goal is
```
⊢ a ≤ b
```

then `rw le_def` will change the goal to

```
⊢ ∃ (c : mynat), b = a + c
```

Occasionally, it is necessary to do a slightly more targetted rewrite. For example if you have proved `add_comm x y : x + y = y + x`, if the goal is

```
⊢ a + b = c + d
```

and you want to change it into

```
⊢ a + b = d + c
```

you can type `rw add_comm c`. Just typing `rw add_comm` will rewrite `a + b` to `b + a`.


symmetry
--------

The `symmetry` tactic will change a goal of the form `a = b` to the goal `b = a`. It will also change a goal of the form `a ≠ b` to a goal of the form `b ≠ a`.

`symmetry at H` will change `H : a = b` to `H : b = a`.


split
-----

The `split` tactic will change a goal of the form `P ∧ Q` into two goals `P` and `Q`. It will also change a goal of the form `P ↔ Q` into two goals `P` and `Q`.

Note that when two goals are created, it is considered best practice to deal with each goal separately in `{ }` brackets. For example if the assumptions and goal look like this:

```
P Q : Prop,
hpq : P → Q,
hqp : Q → P
⊢ P ↔ Q
```

then a proof might look like this:

```
  split,
  {
    exact hpq
  },
  {
    exact hqp
  }
```

intro
-----

The `intro` tactic can be used when the goal looks like `P → Q` or like `∀ x, f x = g x`.

In the `P → Q` case, `intro HP` turns

```
⊢ P → Q
```

to

```
HP : P
⊢ Q
```

and in the `∀ x, f x = g x` case, `intro a` turns
```
⊢ ∀ (x : ℕ), f x = g x
```

to

```
a : ℕ
⊢ f a = g a
```

A variant: the `intros` tactic will introduce more than one variable at once. For example if the state is

```
⊢ ∀ (x y : ℕ), f x y = g x y
```

then `intros a b` turns it into

```
a b : ℕ
⊢ f a b = g a b
```

have
----

If you want to make a new assumption, you can do this with the `have` tactic. For example `have H : 3 + 0 = 3 := add_zero 3` will insert the hypothesis `H : 3 + 0 = 3` into the list of assumptions.

An alternative syntax is `have H : a + b = c,` which then simply adds a new goal `⊢ a + b = c`.

revert
------

The `revert` tactic does the opposite of the `intro` tactic. For example if the state is

```
a : ℕ
⊢ f a = g a
```

then `revert a` will transform it to


```
⊢ ∀ (a : ℕ), f a = g a
```

apply
-----

If the assumptions and goal look like this:

```
H : P → Q
⊢ Q
```

then the tactic `apply H` will change the goal to `⊢ P`.

As a more clever application, `succ_inj` is a proof of
`∀ (m n : ℕ), succ m = succ n → m = n`. If the goal is

```
⊢ a = b
```

then `apply succ_inj` will transform it to

```
⊢ succ a = succ b
```

exfalso
-------

The `exfalso` tactic changes any goal at all to `false`. This is often used when the assumptions are contradictory (e.g. during a proof by contradiction).

Example of usage: if the assumptions and goal are this:

```
hP : P,
hnP : P → false
⊢ Q
```

then a proof could be

```
  exfalso,
  apply hnP,
  exact hP
```

left
----

The `left` tactic changes a goal of the form

```
⊢ P ∨ Q
```

to

```
⊢ P
```

right
-----

The `right` tactic changes a goal of the form

```
⊢ P ∨ Q
```

to

```
⊢ Q
```

congr'
------

The `congr'` tactic changes a goal of the form

```
⊢ f a = f b
```

to a goal of the form

```
⊢ a = b
```

Note that if `f` is not injective then this tactic can change a goal which is true into one which is false.

Example of usage: if the goal is

```
⊢ succ a = succ b
```

then `congr'` changes it to

```
⊢ a = b
```

use
---

The `use` goal works ong oals of the form

```
⊢ ∃ (c : mynat), f c
```

For example, if the goal is

```
⊢ ∃ (c : mynat), c + 2 = 4
```

then `use 2` will change the goal into

```
⊢ 2 + 2 = 4
```

****

Tricks
------

`rw [h1, h2, h3]` is the same as

```
rw h1,
rw h2,
rw h3
```

and `rwa h` is the same as `rw h, try {refl}, try {assumption}`.
